Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Anytime
You clock a butterfly
I flip a switch
Keep a secret,
let you come inside
When I run, I run the gamut
But I could never plan it
I keep on breathin'
when I land it
(Land it)
When I run, I run the gamut
But I could never plan it
I keep on breathin'
when I land it
If you give me a piece
of your heart
You'll keep easy
when we are a part
Of two worlds
It could be nothin'
Maybe it's somethin'
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me, me, me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me, me, me, me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
(Me)
me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Anytime
You clock a butterfly
You flip a switch
Keep a secret,
let me come inside
When you run, you run the gamut
But you could never plan it
You keep on breathin'
when you're in it
If you give me a piece
of your heart
You'll keep easy
when we are a part
Of two worlds
It could be nothin'
Maybe it's somethin'
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on—
If you give me a piece
of your heart
You'll keep easy
when we are a part
Of two worlds
If you give me
a piece of your heart
You'll keep easy
when we are a part
Of two worlds
It could be nothin'
Maybe it's somethin'
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
(If you give me
a piece of your heart)
Keep your eyes on me, me, me
Keep your eyes on me
(You'll keep easy
when we are a part)
Keep your eyes on me, me, me
Keep your eyes on me
(Of two worlds,
I could be nothin')
Keep your eyes on me
(Me)
me
Keep your eyes on me
(Maybe it's somethin')
Keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me
